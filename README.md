## Project Overview  
In this module, we created a table to organize stock option data that is stored in Google Sheets. This table has the ability to filter data based on a drop-down table selection and is created using HTML, CSS, and JS as the primary coding languages.  

## Resources  
- **Software:** VS Code, Google Sheets   
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JS  
- **Data Source:** [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/options/highest-open-interest)    

## Objectives  
- Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset  
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
